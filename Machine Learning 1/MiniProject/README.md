# Mini-Lab: Logistic Regression and SVMs

You are to perform predictive analysis (classification) upon a data set: model the dataset using
methods we have discussed in class: logistic regression and support vector machines, and making
conclusions from the analysis. Follow the CRISP-DM framework in your analysis (you are not
performing all of the CRISP-DM outline, only the portions relevant to the grading rubric outlined
below). This report is worth 10% of the final grade. You may complete this assignment in teams of
as many as three people.
Write a report covering all the steps of the project. The format of the document can be PDF,
*.ipynb, or HTML. You can write the report in whatever format you like, but it is easiest to turn in the
rendered iPython notebook. The results should be reproducible using your report. Please carefully
describe every assumption and every step in your report.
SVM and Logistic Regression Modeling
• [50 points] Create a logistic regression model and a support vector machine model for the
classification task involved with your dataset. Assess how well each model performs (use
80/20 training/testing split for your data). Adjust parameters of the models to make them more
accurate. If your dataset size requires the use of stochastic gradient descent, then linear kernel
only is fine to use.
• [10 points] Discuss the advantages of each model for each classification task. Does one type
of model offer superior performance over another in terms of prediction accuracy? In terms of
training time or efficiency? Explain in detail.
• [30 points] Use the weights from logistic regression to interpret the importance of different
features for each classification task. Explain your interpretation in detail. Why do you think
some variables are more important?
• [10 points] Look at the chosen support vectors for the classification task. Do these provide
any insight into the data? Explain.
